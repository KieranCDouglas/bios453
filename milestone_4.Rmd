## Description of data management utilized and cleaning

As part of the data management process fo this project, I significantly reduced its size to include only variables that I believe are relevant for my research question. This includes all of the relevant variables, in addition to each confounder listed in my concept map (both primary and secondary). Once I had each of these variables selected, In went through and ensured that they were all formatted correctly for the types of regression I wanted to run during my analysis. I also made sure that certain items were filtered out. For example, some continuous reportings like birth weight in kg clearly contained severe misinputs. Since I am also only concerned with it as a numerical variable, I removed some of the categorical sections on the upper end like not weighed at birth, dont know, or missing. Additionally, I chose to adhere to UNICEFâ€™s validity threshold: 250g <= birthweight <=5,500g for a more realistic analysis. I also chose to keep variables like time pregnant and age numeric because that makes sense given what I am interested in exploring. Binary variables like whether or not someone took antiparasitics) were limited to only response values, as I am not interested in those who couldnt answer the question. This leaves us with a hefty 153,582 observations for analysis. Finally, I included a scaled weight column for womens sample weights due to the neture of my analysis (centering around womens reproductive health). I scaled it by 1,000,000 because DHS weights are stored as six digit strings, and scaling is necesary to prevent serious distortions, getting the weights into their correct format.

## Missing data report

According to a missing data summary, there are no missing observations within the cleaned dataset. After removing "dont know" values from majority of the variables of interest (due to their being irrelevent) we no longer have any data that are not available and a final cleaned dataset of 153582 observations.

## Summary and interpretation of characteristics
Based on the characteristics obseved in the table and graphic, a few things stand out. To start, given the fact that the core questions involves antiparasitic drug use, its important to point out that majority of people to not use antiparasitics during pregnancy. Additionally, less than 30% of people have some form of health insurance which may act as a major confounder when trying to predict birth weight. Majority of people surveyed have completed primary school (around 52.2%) but only 2% have some form of higher education. As for age, most of those who participated in the survey were in their late 20s, with a median age of 27 (SD of 5.12). The median birth weight was 2900g, which is less than the international average of roughly 3300g. Based on the graphic, it is evident that on average, children born to mothers who received antiparasitics during pregnancy weighed less at birth than those of mothers who did not. There is also a much larger interquartile range of birthweights for children born to mothers who were insured but did not receive antiparasitics during pregnancy than any other combined category. The Lowest average birth weights were among children born to mothers who were both insured and received antiparasitics during pregnancy. It is possible that due to the large discrepancy between number of insured vs uninsured, this relationship is due to noise, but it is interesting nonetheless. Overall, the spread is relatively consistent across categories.

## Variable selection for statistical analysis and assumption testing

```{r}
## LASSO
# Create predictor matrix (exclude intercept and outcome variable)
x <- model.matrix(bwkg ~ paradrug + insured + csect + anemia + delivplace + 
                  termpreg + bpast5 + wind_urbrur + wind + educ + ethnic + 
                  state + smokes + married + age, 
                data = dhs_clean)[, -1]  # Remove intercept column

# Outcome variable
y <- dhs_clean$bwkg

# Cross-validate to find optimal lambda (penalty parameter)
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
lasso_model <- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha = 1)  # alpha=1 for LASSO

# Plot cross-validation error
plot(lasso_model)

# Coefficients at lambda.min (retains more variables)
coef(lasso_model, s = "lambda.min")

# Coefficients at lambda.1se (simpler model)
coef(lasso_model, s = "lambda.1se")

## Predictors with non-zero coefficients are deemed important for explaining bwkg. It appears as though paradrug is not... We will include those relavent variables in the regression.

## Check for multicolinearity 
vifmod <- lm(data = dhs_clean, bwkg~paradrug+age+ethnic+educ+bpast5+csect+anemia)
vif_values <- vif(vifmod)  # Calculate VIF values
print(vif_values)         # Display VIF values
## VIF are all aprox =1 implying low to no nulticolinearity
```

## Regressions and interpretation

```{r}
## several single stratas, merge singles for comparison

single_strata <- c(1023, 3241, 3261, 57221, 57222, 62921, 83823, 84022, 84122, 84223, 84421, 84621, 84622, 84723, 89823, 83723)  

dhs_clean <- dhs_clean %>%
  mutate(strata = ifelse(strata %in% single_strata, 1024, strata))

# Count PSUs per stratum
psu_counts <- dhs_clean %>%
  group_by(strata) %>%
  summarize(n_psu = n_distinct(ids))  # Replace 'ids' with your PSU variable name

# List strata with 1 PSU
single_strata <- psu_counts %>% filter(n_psu == 1)
print(single_strata)

single_strata <- c(1023, 3241, 3261, 57221, 57222, 62921, 83823, 84022, 84122, 84223, 84421, 84621, 84622, 84723, 89823)

#mutate
dhs_clean <- dhs_clean %>%
  mutate(
    strata = ifelse(strata %in% single_strata, 1024, strata)
  )

## Weighting and survey design specification
sdesign <- as_survey_design(
  .data = dhs_clean,
  ids = ids,
  strata = strata,
  weights = wsweight
)
## Run main regression. Included interraction terms for age*paradrug and educ*bpast5 due to suspected interractions between them and their effect on bwkg, both contain statistically significant outputs. I should include the second interraction term because it's theoretically meaningful (e.g., if it makes sense that the effect of paradrug would vary by age or another variable). This core model is weighted. 
unrefined_coremodel <- sdesign %>% 
  svyglm(
    formula = bwkg~paradrug+age+ethnic+educ+bpast5+csect+anemia+anemia*paradrug+educ*bpast5,
    family = gaussian())
summary(unrefined_coremodel)

## Refined core model
coremodel <- sdesign %>% 
  svyglm(
    formula = bwkg ~ paradrug + age + ethnic + educ + 
                bpast5 + csect + anemia + educ*bpast5,
    family = gaussian()
  )
summary(coremodel)
## Unweighted coremodel
coremodelunw <- lm(data = dhs_clean, bwkg~paradrug+age+ethnic+educ+bpast5+csect+anemia+educ*bpast5)
summary(coremodelunw)

## Finding $R^2$ 
weighted_r2 <- function(model) {
  y <- model.response(model.frame(model))  
  w <- weights(model, type = "prior")      
  pred <- predict(model)
  
  # NA handling 
  valid <- complete.cases(y, pred, w)
  y <- y[valid]
  pred <- pred[valid]
  w <- w[valid]
  
  ss_res <- sum(w * (y - pred)^2)
  ss_tot <- sum(w * (y - weighted.mean(y, w))^2)
  
  1 - (ss_res / ss_tot)
}

# Usage with survey model
coremodel <- svyglm(bwkg ~ paradrug + age, 
                   design = sdesign,
                   family = gaussian())

weighted_r2(coremodel)  
## This implies that the variabce observed in the model can only explain about 0.22% of that observed in the population
```

## Residual analysis, multicolinearity, and validation

```{r}
## Q-Q plot for normality.
# Extract residuals from your svyglm model
residuals <- residuals(coremodel)
#plot
ggplot(data.frame(residuals = residuals), aes(sample = residuals)) +
  stat_qq(color = "#80CFA9") +
  stat_qq_line(color = "#CF80A6", size = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Theoretical quantiles", y = "Ordered Values", 
       title = "Normal Q-Q Plot of Residuals") +
  theme_economist()

## The residuals generally follow the diagonal line, suggesting that the residuals are approximately normally distributed.However, there is some deviation at the tails (both ends of the plot), which could indicate slight non-normality.This could be related to the large sample size.With very large datasets, the Central Limit Theorem ensures that your coefficient estimates are approximately normally distributed even if residuals aren't perfectly normal

# Perform Durbin-Watson test
durbinWatsonTest(coremodel)
## D-W Statistic = 1.914134: This value is reasonably close to 2 (which indicates no autocorrelation), suggesting a mild positive autocorrelation in your residuals.

## Validation K-Fold
# Define cross-validation method
ctrl <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5)

# Train model with k-fold CV
model_cv <- train(
  bwkg ~ paradrug+age+ethnic+educ+bpast5+csect+anemia+age*paradrug+educ*bpast5,  # Include all predictors
  data = dhs_clean,
  method = "lm",
  trControl = ctrl
)
# View average RMSE and RÂ² across folds
print(model_cv$results)
```
The validation results suggest poor model preformance across the board.An RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error, A measure of the average distance between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better fit) of ~548.7 kg means that the models predictions are super inacurate. The R2 of 0.22% indicated that paradrug and other predictors have very minimal explanatory power for bwkg. Low standard deviations (SD) in RMSE/RÂ² across folds indicate the model isnâ€™t overfitting, but itâ€™s consistently underperforming.
